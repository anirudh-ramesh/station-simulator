OCPP Station Simulator
======================
The simulator tool is dedicated for simulation of charging station. It implements [OCPP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Charge_Point_Protocol) and talks to Charging Station Management 
System (CSMS) via WebSocket protocol. At the moment only OCPP 2.0 (download [here](https://www.openchargealliance.org/protocols/ocpp-20/)) is supported.

## Configuration

### Command-line configuration
You can run the simulator by providing configuration directly using the command line:

```bash
./gradlew run -Parguments="ws://${ocpp_endpoint_url} --configuration {configuration_body}"
```

Where configuration body is, an inline JSON-like configuration, with single-quotes around variable names.

**Sample configuration_body**

```
{'stations':[{'id':'EVB-P17390866','evse':{'count':1,'connectors':1}}]}
``` 

**Sample usage**

Starts the simulator with one station, which has a single EVSE and a single connector attached to it:

`./gradlew run -Parguments="ws://{ocpp_endpoint_url} --configuration {'stations':[{'id':'EVB-P17390866','evse':{'count':1,'connectors':1}}]}"`

### File-based configuration
**Configuration file sample**
```YAML
stations:
  - id: EVB-P17390866
    evse:
      count: 1
      connectors: 1
  - id: EVB-P18090564
    evse:
      count: 1
      connectors: 2
      
```

**Sample usage**

`./gradlew run -Parguments="ws://{ocpp_endpoint_url} --configurationFile ./configuration.yml"`

## Run as JAR file
Build it:
```bash
./gradlew build && tar -zxvf simulator-core/build/distributions/simulator-core-shadow.tar
```

Run with file-based configuration:
```bash
java -jar simulator-core-shadow/lib/simulator-core.jar ws://${ocpp_endpoint_url} --configurationFile ./configuration.yml
```
Run with command-line configuration:
```bash
java -jar simulator-core-shadow/lib/simulator-core.jar ws://${ocpp_endpoint_url} --configuration "{'stations':[{'id':'EVB-P17390866','evse':{'count':1,'connectors':1}}]}"
```
## Secure Web-Sockets

`./gradlew run -Parguments="wss://{ocpp_endpoint_url} --configurationFile ./configuration.yml"`

In the simulator configuration specify the following settings:
```YAML
keyStoreFile: path-to-file
keyStorePassword: your-keyStore-password
keyManagerPassword: your-keyManager-password
```
## Use as console tool
Console tool supports user interactions with running stations: plug cable, unplug cable, authorize token, etc.
It launches as part of the station simulator project, and is available for user input.

**List of available actions**

Press `Enter` to see a list of available stations.
To switch between stations enter station's id (e.g. 1, 2, 3) and press `Enter`. 

`plug {evseId} {connectorId}` plug cable in a given connector (e.g. `plug 2 1`)

`unplug {evseId} {connectorId}` unplug cable from a given connector (e.g. `unplug 2 1`)

`auth {tokenId} {evseId}` authorize token at given evse (e.g. `auth 045918E24B4D80 1`)

`stat` show state of selected station

## Use as dependency library
Simulator can be included as a dependency in your project, in order to help facilitate automated testing for CSMS.
At the moment this use-case has not been verified, please try and share your experience with us.

# Design overview

![Architecture diagram of station simulator](./diagram.svg "Architecture diagram of station simulator")

Each station is run by one separate thread, with its own state, call registry and WebSocket connection.

In order to prevent concurrent changes of state any interaction with station is based on message queueing.

In the same manner, station is using message queue to send messages to WebSocketClient, although WebSocketClient can also be accessed by other threads from underlying WebSocket library.
